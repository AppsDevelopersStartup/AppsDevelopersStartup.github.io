<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This privacy policy applies to the Sonic Cleaner app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Kirill Sukharev (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address)</li>
    <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages</li>
    <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
    <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
</ul>

<p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

<p>The Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time with important information, required notices, and marketing promotions.</p>

<p>For a better experience while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information. The information requested will be retained by the Service Provider and used as described in this privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Third Party Access</h2>

<p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties as described in this privacy statement.</p>

<p>The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
    <li>When they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request</li>
    <li>With their trusted service providers who work on their behalf, who do not have an independent use of the information disclosed, and who have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>

<p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

<h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>

<p>The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you'd like them to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact them at <a href="mailto:support@soniccleaner.pro">support@soniccleaner.pro</a> and they will respond in a reasonable time.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. Parents and legal guardians are encouraged to monitor their children's Internet usage and help enforce this Policy by instructing children not to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without permission.

You must be at least 16 years old to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries, parental consent may be required).</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. They provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the information processed and maintained.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>

<p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-11-08</p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>
